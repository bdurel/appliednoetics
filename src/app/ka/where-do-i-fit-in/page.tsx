        The 18th Century Anglo-Irish Bishop George Berkeley noticed that all
        physical objects that an organism comes in contact with are experienced
        as an idea in the mind. He called his philosophy Immaterialism. He
        described a physical object’s stimulation of an organism’s sense organs.
        The sense organs then communicate the stimulation to the central nervous
        system, which communicates it to the brain. Information in the brain is
        then processed by the mind into a coherent, multifaceted picture of the
        local universe. This is experienced by the organism as the present
        moment. This concept of the present is the first building block of the
        noosphere.

        Moments, perceived by an organism through stimulation of the senses and
        mental interpretation, are further interpreted by the organism’s mind as
        being the result of a causal chain. The causal chain is constructed from
        moments stored in the memory of the organism’s mind. Additionally, the
        mind extrapolates the chain towards possible future moments. This causal
        chain of moments formed within an organism’s mind is the experience of
        time. Time has no hard physical reality. You cannot point to a physical
        space that is the past or the future. They both exist in the mind as
        part of the noosphere.

        The mind of an organism is spread through possible universes through
        quantum entanglement with un-collapsed probability waves. When
        anticipating future moments, those that exist in a universe that
        includes the organism’s quantum mind are judged likely possible futures.
        The quantum mind exists in a superposition that includes those possible
        universes. This superposition manifests in an organism’s mind as
        anticipation.

        The negentropy resulting from the perception of an organism’s mind
        manifests as an abstract understanding of the universe, as has been
        previously stated. This abstraction exists in the mind as symbols.
        Greater amounts of negentropy lead to symbols of a greater order of
        abstraction. Over the course of a lifetime the increasingly intricate
        complex of symbols functions as the personality of the organism.
