      <h2>What is the Noosphere?</h2>
      <p>
        At every level the noosphere is both complex and confusing. This is true
        right from the very conception of the idea. Two men may be given credit
        for coming up with the concept. Both men give credit to the other.{" "}

        Valdimir Vernadsky was a geochemist in Soviet Russia in the early
        Twentieth Century. Inspired by Edward Seuss’ 1875 use of the term
        ‘biosphere’ he organized the geological record into spheres of
        composition. The first was the earliest, purely mineral layer of the
        record. This was the geosphere, from the Greek geo for ‘earth’. Next
        came the layer that was affected by life through chemical changes and
        fossil remains. This was the biosphere, from the Greek bio for ‘life’.
        Finally, he borrowed a concept from the lectures of a French
        paleontologist to describe a more recent sphere. It included the record
        influenced by artifacts left by organized minds: tools, industrial
        environmental changes, and artistic record. This was the noosphere, from
        the Greek noos for ‘mind’. Vernadsky noted that in each successive
        sphere the amount of information that could be gleaned from the record
        increased exponentially.

        At the same time Abbe Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a Jesuit priest in
        France. He was also the paleontologist that had inspired Vladimir
        Vernadsky. The Abbe often found himself in trouble with the Church for
        his thoughts on evolution, which were informed by his discipline of
        paleontology and made the Church very uncomfortable. Teilhard de Chardin
        used his conception of the noosphere to reconcile his thoughts on
        evolution with the Church’s stance on Creation. This reconciliation lay
        in the exponential increase of information within the progression of
        Vernadskian spheres, which the priest called ‘an intensification of
        information.’ Following this intensification to its extreme conclusion
        the priest hypothesized a noetic point of maximum information
        intensification, a Noetic Singularity. This point would include all
        information, an understanding of everything, a point of absolute
        abstraction. The priest viewed this as analogous to the Second Coming of
        Christ and called it the Omega Point. The intensification of information
        was a direction in evolution that led to heaven.{" "}

        So, not only do both men credit the origin of the idea with the other,
        but they also both use the idea in quite different ways. Is the
        noosphere a scientific class within the geologic record? Is it a
        mystical system for union with God?{" "}
